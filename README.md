# CS340
Repository for my work in CS340 at SNHU, Client-Server Development, MongoDB and Python, specifally the second project
which consisters of a "CRUD" python library written in python to access a MongoDB, and a script to run in 
Juypter Notebooks that will create a web based dashboard using Dash.

The CRUD file was written for a specific database, thus its name, animalshelter.py, but it can be easily modified to 
work with any Mongo database. I tried to made the code as documented as I could, so the changes could be made by anyone
even me in the distant future when I've forgotten what I've done.

The project was done incrementally, as I learned more about Mongo, Pymongo, Juypter Notebook, and ultimately Dash. This
incremental or iterative development is what I have learned and used in most other CS classes at SNHU and is very
helpful in both learning how to do something and actually accomplishing a fairly large project (or mid sized).

Computer scientists ultimately write programs that help other people. In this case, a rescue group that wanted to 
recruit animals from a shelter. Had it been an actual client, we likely would have had communication regard several points, 
such as just what Newfoundland mixes are acceptable for water rescue dogs (as an example). But essentially it helps the
group identify candidate animals for training, out of 1000s, much quicker than looking through the records manually.
